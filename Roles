How to maintain a directory structure?

Step 1: Create a MyProject Directory ~/myproj/
Step 2: By default you will have ansible.cfg
Step 3: Create seperate Inventory files according to environments
               -> inventory-dev
               -> inventory-prod
Step 4: Main playbook in project will be as site.yml
Step 5: In site.yml we can in-built all types of playbooks, roles etc.. It is like master playbook.
Step 6: We can make us of file.yml as it redirect to roles. We can perform tasks in roles directory
Step 7: As the project is groiwng try to increase the group vars and host vars.
Step 8: Maintain best directory structure.

What are the Roles in Ansible?
Ansible roles and playbooks are very much similar.
Roles also contains has same code used in playbook.
Roles are used to reuse the code in playbooks.
Roles structure
    -> has defaults - contains default values of roles
    -> files - contains static files
    -> handlers- define in main.yml
    -> meta - has dependencies, author information
    -> tasks - has info about tasks, roles
    -> templates - has info about templates
    -> test - optional has inventory file
    -> vars - has information about standard variables

Roles Locations
    -> ./roles                 > highest precedance
    -> /.ansible/roles
    -> /etc/ansible/roles
    ->/etc/share/ansible/roles

Roles Writing
- name: roles
  hosts: all
  roles:
    - role 1
    - role 2
    - var 1
    - var 2

Roles Example
We can install roles plugins from galaxy ansible.

If playbook has both the roles and tasks, the weightage is given more roles instead of tasks. First roles then tasks and then handlers.
If we want to run task before the role we need to define then in pre_tasks.
- name: run a task before a role
  hosts: all
  pre-tasks:
    - name: update yum cache
      yum:
        update_cache: yes
  roles:
   - motd
