What are the Variables
Ansible supports the variables that can be used throughout the project. In ansible we use variables mostly to create users, installation of packages, service, archive or retrieve.

How to declare a variable in Ansible?
Valid variables should starts with letters and should not contain special characters.
Examples: Web_Server, Remote_file, file_1 etc..

How we use variables in ansible?
We can use variables in Playbook, inclusion files.

How to define variables ?
One should define variables on vars block. When variable is given in files it can be used dynamically
Ex(Playbook): _ hosts: all
                vars:
                  web_package: httpd

Ex(files): _ hosts: all
                vars_files:
                    vars/users.yml

Always variables are defined in {{}}
    -> Example: {{web_package: httpd}}
In condition statements we don't use curly braces {{}}.
If variable is first element it should be defined in "".
Example:
    ->_ name : create a user using variable
        hosts: all
        vars:
          user: lisa
        tasks:
          - name: create a user {{ user }}
            user:
              name: "{{ user }}"


What is the Precedance of Variables?
 -> Global Scope: Inventory and Command line variable
 -> Play scope: When Set in Play
 -> Host Scope: When host variable set in inclusion file

 -> Command line variable has highest precedance over all variables.
    -> Examplw: ansible-playbook site.yaml -e "web_package=sshd"

What are buitlin varibles?
There are some builtin vaiables available in ansible which are readily available to use.
Example: hostnames
         groups
         group_names

How to manage host variables?
Variables can be assigned to host or group of hosts.
Example Single Host
    [Servers]
    ansiblehost 1
        web_package: httpd

Example Multiple Host
    [Servers:vars]
        web_package: httpd

Example Host Files
    ~/myproject/host_vars/ansiblehosts1
We can give specific variables to particular host

Example for Groups
   ~/myproject/group_vars/<webservers>
        -> Ex: web_package: httpd

Ansible picks up automatically variables from the destination.


What are multivalued variables?
Multivalued variables are used through arrays or dictionaries.

[
user1_first_name: s
user1_last_name: chaviti
user1_home_dir: /users/schaviti
]

How to define Mutlivalued using Arrays"}
users:
  - first_name: s
    last_name: chaviti
    home_dir: /users/schaviti

How to define Mutlivalued using Dictionary"}
users:
    schaviti:
        first_name: s
        last_name: chaviti
        shell: /bin/bash
or
schaviti:{first_name: 's', last_name: 'chaviti', shell: '/bin/bash'}


How to access the variable in multivalued variables?
Example(Arrays) : users.schaviti.first_name
                  users.schaviti.last_name
Example(Dictionary): users['schaviti']['first_name']
                     users['schaviti']['last_name']


-> In array specified multivalued variables we can use loops etc..
-> In dictionary multivalued variables we cannot use loops etc..


How to manage encrypted data in ansible?
Managing secrets in ansible is possible with ansible vault.
Whenever there is a requirement of processing sensitive data like passwords, webkeys we need to follow a secure way through ansible vault

Ansible vault is used to encrypt and decrypt the data.
 -> Command               = ansible-vault
 -> Create Encrypt file   = ansible-vault create <filename>
 -> View file             = ansible-vault view <filename>
 -> Edit file             = ansible-vault edit <filename>
 -> Encrypt file          = ansible-vault encrypt <filename>
 -> Decrypt file          = ansible-vault decrypt <filename>
 -> Change password       = ansible-vault rekey <filename>

 How to create secret vault file?
 -> Create a Vault file      = ansible-vault create secret.yaml
 -> Set Password
 -> Create a Username and Password
    username: Kishore
    pwhash: password

How to use vault file?
-> Firstly create a User creation file.
 - name: create a user
   hosts: all
   vars_files:
     - secret.yaml
   tasks:
     - name: creating user
       user:
        name: "{{ username }}"
        password: "{{ pwhash }}"
 -> Run the created file
    -> ansible-playbook --ask-vault-pass <filename>
It will ask the password before, So to prevent this we shall use below
 -> Store password
    -> echo <password> > valut_pass
 -> Run the created file
     -> ansible-playbook --vault-password-file=valut_pass <filename>
